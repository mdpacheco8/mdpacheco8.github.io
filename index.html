        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I build clean, responsive websites that help businesses grow. I blend technical skill with visual intuition, and have a strong background in software engineering and game development.</p>
        <p>I have been a software engineer for the last 5 years, woring on an enterprise SaaS product as my day job. I enjoy making games and personal programs that make my day to day life easier. I recently have had to set up a few websites for friends and family, and started to enjoy it. I am hoping to help out other small business gain an online presence with quick turnarounds and little hassle.</p>
